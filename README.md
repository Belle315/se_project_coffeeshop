# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

possibly adding some kind of animation/ movemnet to the top of the website / header would make the website more appealing. Also possibly adding some kind of sound / music to the over all page.
